Summoning the Edge of Madness Event
The Edge of Madness is a subzone of Zul'Gurub, located just past Zanza's Rise, turning right at the crossroads there. In this area, players will find tablets talking about each of the four possible bosses, and a lit brazier. A fifth tablet is located behind the brazier - Alchemists that interact with the brazier will learn the formula for the Gurubashi Mojo Madness potion. Everyone who's an Alchemist in the raid can learn the recipe there.

To craft the Gurubashi Mojo Madness potion, you need 1 Blood of Heroes, 1 Massive Mojo, 6 Powerful Mojo and 1 Black Lotus. Once the potion is made, you can trade it away or even sell it on the Auction House. When the Gurubashi Mojo Madness potion is used by the brazier in the Edge of Madness area, it will extinguish the brazier, summoning one of the Edge of Madness bosses.
