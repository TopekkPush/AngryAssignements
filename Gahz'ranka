Tips:
To summon Gahz'ranka, you first need to get the right items. 
To the south of the temple where High Priestess Arlokk resides, you will find a ramp to the riverbank. 
By following the ramp, you will find an abandoned camp with some overturned jars and chairs that can be interacted with (the area is named Pagle's Pointe). 
In one of those jars you can find Nat's Measuring Tape, which starts the quest Nat's Measuring Tape. 
This quest simply requires you to return the measuring tape to Nat Pagle, who can be found fishing in the waters of Dustwallow Marsh. 
After turning in the Nat's Measuring Tape quest, Nat Pagle will now sell Mudskunk Lure for 1.
Purchase a Mudskunk Lure from Nat Pagle and head back to Zul'Gurub. 
Along the river inside the raid instance, you will find special pools of fish, Muddy Churning Waters. 
Fish in them until you loot 5 Zulian Mudskunk.
Once you have the Mudskunk Lure and the 5 Zulian Mudskunks, head back to Pagle's Pointe, where you found Nat's Measuring Tape. 
Using the Mudskunk Lure in the water by the camp will invoke Gahz'ranka.
