Consumes: 

{skull} MT1, MT2, MT3
{x} Hunter1, Hunter2, Mage1, Mage2
{square} Hunter1, Hunter2, Hunter3

Tactics:
Pull:   Spread out in the whole room and let MTs build threat (/dance)
Phase:  "Cause Insanity" will be cast on the MT, he wont lose threat but is MC'd for the duration.
        "Son of Hakkar" needs to be missdirected to the raid and sheeped by Mages
Siphon: Stack at {square}
        AOE adds and every raid member needs to get "Poisonoues Blood" debuff from the puddle the adds left behind
        Healers top off the raid before "Blood Siphon"
       
Tips: Tanks use all AOE abilities like taunt etc. on CD for MC (Hakkar cant be taunted)
      Corrupted Blood happens roughly every 20 seconds.
